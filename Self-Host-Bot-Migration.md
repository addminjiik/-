Please note - up until 6/6/2017 your BotSettings were housed in C:\ProgramData\CouchBot. This has changed, and it sits in the same directory as MTD.CouchBot.exe, the executable that runs the bot itself. 

**!!!!!BEFORE YOU UPGRADE - PLEASE BACK UP YOUR FILE AT C:\ProgramData\CouchBot\BotSettings.json!!!!!**

In fact, might do you good just to backup all of C:\ProgramData\CouchBot before updating.

You can then copy/paste the values from it, into the new BotSettings.json file.

Once you've backed your settings file up, please follow the next 2 steps:

1. [Installation of the Bot Files](https://github.com/dawgeth/CouchBot/wiki/Self-Host-Bot-Installation)
2. [Configuration of the Bot](https://github.com/dawgeth/CouchBot/wiki/Self-Host-Bot-Configuration)
