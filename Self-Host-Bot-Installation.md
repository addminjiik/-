1. Download and install ASP.Net Core - The Latest Version. This can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) - It's untested on Linux/Mac - but should function with some [bot configuration](https://github.com/dawgeth/CouchBot/wiki/Self-Host-Bot-Configuration).  
2. Download the CouchBot files via [http://couchbot.io/release/CouchBot.zip].  
3. Unzip the file.  
4. If using Windows, run Start Bot.bat.
